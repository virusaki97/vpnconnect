# VPNClient
Uses a free Vpn service co connect to Host to VPN. Also allows the host to select hist own preffered settings.
Make sure you have the DotRas.for.Win8 NuGet installed.
The connection might start pretty slow and if it does not work make sure to set the VPN server correctly (in the \VPNData\default_list.txt set the correct username and password from https://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn and then build again. Or you can either set your own VPN server).
